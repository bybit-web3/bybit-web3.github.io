### Create a Local Password

After installation, click on the Bybit Wallet icon to create a local password. The local password is used to encrypt the locally stored private keys and user data, as well as to lock the screen. It will not be sent to the server. If the local password is lost, the wallet cannot be recovered, so please remember it carefully.

## Create Wallet / Log in to Account

Currently, Bybit Wallet only supports hosted wallets, where the private keys are managed by Bybit Wallet and users do not need to save the private keys themselves.
